Other Requirements:
Students are accepted for FALL, SPRING and SUMMER.
Students are admitted on a SPACE AVAILABLE BASIS ONLY after a holistic review.  Space is extremely limited.
Students must be in good academic standing (not on academic probation).
Students must submit a plan of study for the desired concentration that is endorsed by the Director or the MDE/IDES advisor. SeeMultidisciplinary Engineering Studies websitefor details.
Average GPA of 2.5 in a minimum of 6 credits in engineering courses 200+ level (AAE, ABE, BME, CE, CEM, CHE, ECE, EEE, ENE, ENGR, EPCS, IDE, IE, ME, MSE, NUCL) taken at Purdue prior to CODO.
Minimum semester GPA of 2.5
Students who are more than 30 credits from completing the minimum 120 credit degree requirements must have an overall cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher. Students requiring 16 to 30 credits for degree completion need an overall cumulative 2.55 GPA, and students requiring 15 or less credits for degree completion need an overall cumulative 2.4 GPA. Students who have completed all the MDE degree requirements need an overall cumulative GPA of 2.0 (same as applied to students in the program).
Students who were in IDES or MDE at one time and processed a CODO out to another program will not be allowed to CODO back into IDES or MDE.
TheIDES/MDE websitehas more information for Reentry and Readmit students interested in changing their major to IDES/MDE.
